We propose a differentiable framework to estimate underwater scene geometry along with the time-varying water surface. The inputs to our model are a video sequence captured by a fixed camera. Dense correspondence from each frame to a world reference frame (selected from the input sequences) is pre-computed, ensuring the reconstruction is performed in a unified coordinate system. We feed the flow fields, together with initialized water surfaces and scene geometry (all are initialized as planar surfaces), into the framework, which incorporates ray casting, Snellâ€™s law and multi-view triangulation. The gradients of the specially designed losses with respect to water surfaces and scene geometry are back-propagated, and all parameters are simultaneously optimized. The final result is a quality reconstruction of the underwater scene, along with an estimate of the time-varying water-air interface. The data shown here was captured in a public fountain environment.

### Prerequisite
The code was tested with python>=3.7 & PyTorch>=1.3 & cuda>=10.0 on Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti<br>
Minor change on the code if there is compatibility issue. It needs around 10 GB GPU memory.

### Setup
```
conda create -n moving_water python=3.7
conda activate moving_water

conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge opencv scikit-image
conda install -c anaconda scipy
```

### Run the code
Please go to `example` folder, download the cached coefficient matrices (there are three matrices for each example) and execute:
```
python3 run.py
```
