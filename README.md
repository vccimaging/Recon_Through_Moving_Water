We propose a differentiable framework to estimate underwater scene geometry along with the time-varying water surface. The inputs to our model are a video sequence captured by a fixed camera. Dense correspondence from each frame to a world reference frame (selected from the input sequences) is pre-computed, ensuring the reconstruction is performed in a unified coordinate system. We feed the flow fields, together with initialized water surfaces and scene geometry (all are initialized as planar surfaces), into the framework, which incorporates ray casting, Snellâ€™s law and multi-view triangulation. The gradients of the specially designed losses with respect to water surfaces and scene geometry are back-propagated, and all parameters are simultaneously optimized. The final result is a quality reconstruction of the underwater scene, along with an estimate of the time-varying water-air interface. The data shown here was captured in a public fountain environment.
